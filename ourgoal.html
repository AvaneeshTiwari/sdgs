        <h1 class="title_h1">The Issues Concerning Life On Land</h1>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>1. Forests are being cut down, which is reducing the natural habitat of many animals.</p>
            <p> Due to this, many animals are being endangered.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>2. Cutting down nature cover causes floods, landslides to be more devastating.</p>
            <p> This is because trees prevent excess run-off and enforces grip on soil, thus reducing the   effects of a flood and landslide.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>3. Massive forest fires are causing us to lose good land, which could be use for human   habitation or farming.</p>
            <p> This is mostly due to human carelessness, or sometimes due to natural reasons like lightning.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>4. More and more land is being used as population increases. This leads to the need for more infrastructure that in turn needs more land.</p>
            <p>A lot of the land used by infrastructure would have been a haven for animals to live in.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>5. Animals on land are also reducing due to hunting and poaching.</p>
            <p>Only the precious parts of animals bodies are removed. But the animal still dies as sometimes they need the specific body part that was removed for their survival.</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h1 class="title_h1">The Solution</h1>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>1. Promote afforestation</p>
            <p>Afforestation is the establishment of a forest or stand of trees in an area where there was no previous tree cover. This will help keep the natural cover up and keep the resources from the trees renewable to us.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>2. Do not cut trees in marshy areas or areas with loose soil.</p>
            <p>Since trees help keep the soil firm and intact, and prevent excess run-off, it prevents any chance of floods and landslides occuring.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>3. Exercise caution with fire near any forests.</p>
            <p>Since nature cover tends to have a lot of natural fuels, its best we either don't light fires, or exercise utmost caution while lighting them</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>4. Preventing over-population and trying to be as efficient with land as possible.</p>
            <p>By utilisng land efficiently for our infrastructure, we create more space for plants and animals to thrive in.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in">
            <p>5. Ban poaching and hunting of endangered animals.</p>
            <p>Since many animals are going extinct, it is best that we ban poaching and hunting of animals for their ivory.</p>
        </div>
