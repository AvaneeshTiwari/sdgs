    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>No Poverty</h1><h2>Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Zero Hunger</h1><h2>he number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because of rapid economic growth and increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their nutritional needs.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Good Health And Well-Being</h1><h2>Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of the two.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Quality Education</h1><h2>Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrolment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Gender Equality</h1><h2>Ending all discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, it’s crucial for sustainable future; it’s proven that empowering women and girls helps economic growth and development.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Clean Water And Sanitation</h1><h2>Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people, an alarming figure that is projected to rise as temperatures do. Although 2.1 billion people have improved water sanitation since 1990, dwindling drinking water supplies are affecting every continent.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Affordable And Clean Energy</h1><h2>Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people with electricity increased from 78 to 87 percent, and the numbers without electricity dipped to just below one billion.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Decent Work And Economic Growth</h1><h2>Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined dramatically, despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In developing countries, the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of total employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Industry Innovation And Infrastructure</h1><h2>Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Reduced Inequalities</h1><h2>Income inequality is on the rise—the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of global income whereas the poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. If we take into account population growth inequality in developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Sustainable Cities And Communities</h1><h2>More than half of us  live in cities. By 2050, two-thirds of all humanity—6.5 billion people—will be urban. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Responsible Consumption And Production</h1><h2>Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide, and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater for human use.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Climate Action</h1><h2>There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are more than 50 percent higher than in 1990. Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not act.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Life Below Water</h1><h2>The world’s oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and life – drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole, and to counterbalance the effects of climate change.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Life On Land</h1><h2>Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resources.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Peace Justice And Strong Institutions</h1><h2>We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace, stability, human rights and effective governance, based on the rule of law. Yet our world is increasingly divided.</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="goal_div">
        <br><br>
        <p><h1>Partnerships For The Goals</h1><h2>The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships and cooperation. Official Development Assistance remained steady but below target, at US$147 billion in 2017. While humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters continue to demand more financial resources and aid. Many countries also require Official Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade.</h2></p>
